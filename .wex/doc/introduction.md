### **Pseudocode Generator**

## **Overview**

The **Pseudocode Generator** is a tool that analyzes PHP code and produces a structured YAML representation of its elements, including:

- Classes and their methods
- Functions
- Constants

In addition to extracting the code structure, it also gathers all related documentation, such as PHPDoc comments and inline annotations.

## **Key Technical Details**

The purpose of pseudocode is to extract general information about the code without being tied to any specific underlying technology. For example, a configuration generated from a Doctrine entity could be used to produce code for frameworks like Prisma or SQLAlchemy.

### Configuration Objects

The system uses a chain of configuration objects to construct the final representation:

- **Individual Configuration:** Each code element (such as a class, property, or function) is managed by its own configuration class.
- **Contextual Reference:** Configuration objects can reference their parent context via the `parentConfig` parameter.
- **Recursive Assembly:** The complete output structure is built by recursively calling the `toConfig()` method on these objects.

### Testing

- **Test Command:** The command to run tests within the container is stored in the `TEST_COMMAND_SINGLE_FAIL` variable in the `.wex/.env` file.
- **Temporary Files:** During tests, generated files are saved in a temporary directory inside the container at `/tmp/pseudocode_tests`.
  - **Access Outside the Container:** To access this directory from outside, create a symbolic link that points from `/tmp/pseudocode_tests` to your package directory.

For example, run the following commands:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/pseudocode_tests/
mkdir /var/www/html/vendor-local/wexample/pseudocode/tmp
ln -s /var/www/html/vendor-local/wexample/pseudocode/tmp /tmp/pseudocode_tests
```

### Adding a Configuration

1. **Specify the Annotation:**  
   Define the annotation to be recognized. For example:
   ```php
   #[ORM\Id]
   ```

2. **Define the Pseudocode Output:**  
   Determine the corresponding pseudocode format. For example:
   ```yaml
   item:
     - name: ...
       database:
         primary: true
   ```

3. **Create the Configuration File:**  
   Add a configuration file in the `src/Config` directory. This file should be responsible for:
  - Parsing the code to generate pseudocode.
  - Converting the pseudocode back into actual code.
